QUESTION
Easy 1
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal 
substring consisting of non-space characters only.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
'''

#Code ->

def lengthOfLastWord(s):
    wordList = s.split()
    lastWord = wordList[-1]
    return len(lastWord)

s = "Hello World"
result = lengthOfLastWord(s)
print(result)

'''
TRACING:
First I create a function called lengthOfLastWord with one parameter, 
that is, 's' which is the input string
Next, I use the split() function to convert the string into a list
and I will store the value into a variable called 'wordList'
For example, the string is "Hello World". 
When I use the split function, the output will be ->
["Hello", "World"]

Next I will access the last element of the list using wordList[-1] 
and store that value in a variable called lastWord

Finally I will return the length of lastWord, which is the expected
output.
